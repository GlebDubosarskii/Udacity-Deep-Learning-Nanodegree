## Project Overview

In this project, I define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, I  visualize the results of the trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

### Data
I use the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train adversarial networks.
