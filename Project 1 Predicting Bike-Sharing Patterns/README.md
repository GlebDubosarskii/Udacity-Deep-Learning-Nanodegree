## Project Overview

![types of bikes](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/allbikes-1539286251.jpg?crop=0.659xw:1.00xh;0.317xw,0&resize=640:*)



The aim of the project is to predict the number of rented bicycles depending on the date, temperature, humidity, and other factors. The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). The neural network is implemented from scratch without using packages like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
