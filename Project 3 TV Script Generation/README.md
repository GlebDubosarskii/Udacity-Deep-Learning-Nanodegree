## Project Overview

In this project, I generate new [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using LSTMs.  I use part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons (data folder).  The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
