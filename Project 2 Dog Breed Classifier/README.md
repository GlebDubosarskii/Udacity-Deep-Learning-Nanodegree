## Project Overview



![Sample Output][image1]

This project focuses on the classification of dog breeds (133 breeds). First, you need to use a deep neural network that reaches an accuracy of 10%. My network categorizes dogs with 30% accuracy. Next, you need to improve the performance of the network using transfer learning. After I retrained the VGG-16 for this task, the classification accuracy went up to 82%! The project also includes the localization of human faces using the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers.




## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
		cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
	```
   

__NOTE:__ if you are using the Udacity workspace, you *DO NOT* need to re-download the datasets in steps 2 and 3 - they can be found in the `/data` folder as noted within the workspace Jupyter notebook.

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN is taking too long to train, feel free to pursue one of the options under the section __Accelerating the Training Process__ below.
